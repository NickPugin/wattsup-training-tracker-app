# WattsUp Avatar Style Guide

This document defines the strict visual parameters for generating rider profile avatars for the WattsUp application. 

When generating *any* new avatar, the following prompt must be used verbatim, replacing only the `[SUBJECT]` variable with the desired animal or object. You should also use the existing `public/avatars/cactus.png` as a reference image to guarantee style alignment.

## The Standard Prompt

```text
A sporty chibi mascot vector illustration of a [SUBJECT] designed as a profile avatar. The energy and vibe of the character should strongly reflect a combination of sporty athleticism and the unique, playfully competitive nature of the [SUBJECT].

The character must have chibi proportions (a large head/body ratio with small, stubby limbs), BUT it must strongly retain the unique biological characteristics and silhouette of the [SUBJECT]. For example, a shark must have a sharp snout and a dorsal fin, a labrador must have floppy ears, a snout, and a goofy hanging tongue, and an octopus must have visible tentacles. Do not force every subject into a perfect circle or identical pill shape.

Furthermore, the character should NOT always be standing in a stiff, generic, neutral pose. Seat or pose them in a way that feels natural and characteristic to that specific animal (e.g., a panda sitting on its bum, a monkey hanging or crouching, a sloth lounging).

The expression should be confident, active, and playfully competitive, tailored to the specific nature of the subject (avoid overly baby-ish or overly aggressive expressions). 

The character is wearing a colorful, detailed cycling helmet with straps fastened under the chin, but is NOT riding a bicycle. DO NOT use cycling glasses.

The artwork must feature thick, dark, uniform outlines (like a high-quality die-cut sticker). The coloring should use vibrant but natural flat colors, enhanced with very subtle, clean cel-shading (a core shadow on one side, a slight highlight on the other) to give it a 3D pop. Avoid harsh neon "highlighter" colors. 

The entire illustration must be perfectly framed and centered within a solid, soft pastel background color that complements the subject.
```

## Key Aesthetic Pillars
1. **Chibi Mascot Vibe:** Sporty and confident, with an energy that reflects the competitive nature of the specific subject. Avoid making them look like baby toys.
2. **Unique Proportions:** Chibi (large head, stubby limbs), but MUST retain the defining anatomical features of the subject (snouts, manes, fins, tentacles).
3. **Cycling Gear:** Must have a detailed cycling helmet with straps. No bikes. No sunglasses.
4. **Line Art & Rendering:** Thick, dark vector outlines. Vibrant, natural colors with clean, subtle cel-shading (not entirely flat, not 3D rendered).
5. **Background:** A solid, soft pastel color that makes the thick outlines pop.
